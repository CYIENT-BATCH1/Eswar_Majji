2. Write a code to swap even bits with odd bits in unsigned long variable(uint64).


Example: bit 0 with bit 1; bit 2 with bit 3; bit 4 with bit


Algorithm
-> read a number from user
-> check 0th position bit check if it is 0 or not
    -> if it is 0 
        -> check 1st position bit is 1 or not
            -> if it is 1 , set 0th bit 
            -> clear 1st bit
    -> if it is 1
        -> check 1st position bit is 0 or not
            -> if it is 0, clear 0th bit
            -> set 1st bit
-> repeat above coditional steps
-> print above swapped number
