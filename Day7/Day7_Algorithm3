Write program to clear(0) bits CIS, CM2, CM1, CM0 in register “CMCON” if bits CHS3, CHS2, CHS1, CHS0 bits are set to 0x07 in register “ADCON0”


Algorithm
->Read register “CMCON”
->Read register “ADCON0”
->chech 5 4 3 2 bits of register “ADCON0”are equivlent to 7 or not
-> if equal clear(0) bits CIS, CM2, CM1, CM0 in register “CMCON”
