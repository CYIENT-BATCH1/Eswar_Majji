15. Find empty strings in an array of strings (Array of strings will be given as input to program) and 
print the position of array where empty string is present.
And replace the empty string array element as “CYIENT”



reasons for using 0 as empty string :
-> we can read string by using selective scanf , gets and getc 
-> but while using scanf we cannot enter empty string
-> when gets is used we can not get expected output  in  all compilers
->  using getc is not proper way
-> so , i am taking here 0 as empty string
Algorithm
-> initialize 2d array
-> read string (take 0 as empty string)
-> check each string == 0
    -> if equal
    -> replace with CYIENT
-> repeat above three steps untill NULL character
