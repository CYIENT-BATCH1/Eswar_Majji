Requirement 1:

Acceleration sensor data is captured in a 2-dimension array as “ Sensor_Values[ Timestamp_Value][ Sensor _Data]”.
Time stamp interval = 10 ms incremental
Number of data samples = 20 (20 time stamp samples, 20 data samples)
The Sensor_Data is considered as noise if values is < 0x05 and > 0xF0.
Output 1 : Print the time stamp where data is coming as noise.
Output 2 : Delete the noise data and write valid sensor values to new 2-dimension array “ Sensor_noNoice_Value[ Timestamp_Value][ Sensor _Data]” and 
print them – timestamp and values.

Algorithm :


->initialize Sensor_Values[ 20[ Sensor _Data]
-> read elements to Sensor_Values[ Timestamp_Value][ Sensor _Data] array
-> check data at each time stamp 
-> if the data is less than 0x05 or greater than 0xF0 then print that noise data
-> and making noise data 0s after printing
-> and assign the non zero values in Sensor_Values[ Timestamp_Value][ Sensor _Data] to Sensor_noNoice_Value[ Timestamp_Value][ Sensor _Data]
-> and print the Sensor_noNoice_Value[ Timestamp_Value][ Sensor _Data] array data




Algorithm :
-> read no of time stamps from user
-> initialize 4 arrays : PC, PR,PL and F_P_Data array
-> read the data into PC,PR,PL arrays
-> print the PL,PC and PR arrays data
-> call the function to assign the three arrays data into F_P_Data array by passing thses 4 arrays as arguments
-> check data of PR at 0 time stamp is in between 0x05 and 0xF5
-> if it is true assign the data into final array
-> else check at next 5th data
-> check data of PC at next 5th  is in between 0x05 and 0xF5
-> if it is true assign the data into F_P_Data
-> else check data at next 5th data
-> check data of PC at next 5th  is in between 0x05 and 0xF5
-> if it is true assign the data into F_P_Data
-> else check data at next 5th data
-> repeat the above 9 steps until max size three arrays
-> return the array to main function 
-> call the function which the F_P_Data array 
-> check the data is greater than 0x55 continously 5 times with the help of count and flags
-> if condition true return air bag is deployed
-> else air bag is not deployed
