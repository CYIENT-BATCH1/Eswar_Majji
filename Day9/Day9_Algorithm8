8. I). Write program to set (1) bits CIS, C2OUT, C1OUT in register “CMCON” 
if bits CHS3, CHS2, CHS1 bits are set to 0x06 in register “ADCON0”

Algorithm
-> Read register “ADCON0”
-> check register “ADCON0” is equal to 0x06
    -> if it is equal 
    -> read register “CMCON”
    -> arrange the 3 7 6 bits of register “CMCON” in the following order
    -> and set those bit position
-> print that value
