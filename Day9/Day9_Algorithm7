Set the register SSPSTAT value such a way that bit CKE, P and S bit are cleared (0), 
without disturbing the other bits.

II). Find out the value of UA, BF, SMP bits in SSPSTAT register if the value of the register is 0x55

Algorithm
-> Read register SSPSTAT value
-> copy the register SSPSTAT value to another variable
-> clear 7 5 4 bits in register SSPSTAT
-> check if the copied variable is equal to 0x55 or not
    -> if equal
    -> Find out the value of UA, BF, SMP bits
-> printing that value
