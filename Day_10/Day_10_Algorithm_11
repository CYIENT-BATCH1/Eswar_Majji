11. Write a function to store "G_Str_SteeringAngle_sint" to "G_Msg_SteeringInformation_Byte" as shown below.

signed int G_Str_SteeringAngle_sint = -60;


unsigned char G_Msg_SteeringInformation_Byte[3u];"

Algorithm
-> intitialize unsigned char G_Msg_SteeringInformation_Byte[3u] 
-> call the function and pass the array
-> initialize signed int G_Str_SteeringAngle_sint = -60
-> Extract bit 11 to bit 10 from G_Str_SteeringAngle_sint and assign to G_Msg_SteeringInformation_Byte[0] at bit 1 to bit 0
-> Extract bit 9 to bit 2 from G_Str_SteeringAngle_sint and assign to G_Msg_SteeringInformation_Byte[1] at bit 7 to bit 0
-> Extract bit 1 to bit 0 from G_Str_SteeringAngle_sint and assign to G_Msg_SteeringInformation_Byte[2] at bit 7 to bit 6
-> Remaining all are 0s
