10. Write a function to store "G_Eng_EngineTemperature_uchar" and 
"G_Eng_EngineRpm_uint" into " G_Msg_EngineInformation_Byte[5u]" as shown below.

unsigned char G_Eng_EngineTemperature_uchar = 50u ;

unsigned int G_Eng_EngineRpm_uint = 1000u;

unsigned char G_Msg_EngineInformation_Byte[5u];

Algorithm 
-> initialize  unsigned int G_Eng_EngineRpm_uint = 1000u, unsigned char G_Eng_EngineTemperature_uchar = 50u, unsigned int G_Msg_EngineInformation_Byte[5u];
-> Extract bit 12 to bit 9 from Engine RPM and assign to unsigned int G_Msg_EngineInformation_Byte[0] at bit 3 to bit 0
-> Extract bit 8 to bit 1 from Engine RPM and assign to unsigned int G_Msg_EngineInformation_Byte[1] at bit 7 to bit 0
-> Extract bit 7 from Engine RPM and assign to unsigned int G_Msg_EngineInformation_Byte[2] at bit 7
-> Extract bit 7 to bit 0 from Engine Temparature and assign to unsigned int G_Msg_EngineInformation_Byte[3] at bit 7 to bit 0
-> remaining all 0s
