Set the register T0CON value such a way that bit TMR0ON and PSA bit are set (1), 
without disturbing the other bits.

II). Find out the value of T0PS2, T0PS1, T0PS0 bits in T0CON register if the value of the register is 0xF3

Algorithm
-> Read Tcon register
-> copy that register to another variable
-> set bits at 3rd and 7th bit position
-> check copied variable is equal to 0xF3 or not
    -> if equal 
    -> find out equavlent value of 2 1 0 bits position
-> print that value
