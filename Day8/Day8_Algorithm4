Realize a function which has 2 arguments and 1 return value. Argument 1 is Byte value, Argument 2 is bit position.
Function has to flip the bit position (as per argument 2) in argument 1 byte value and return complete byte value.

Algorithm 
-> read number and considering byte
-> read bit position 
-> check whether entered number is less than 256 or not
-> if condition true
  -> call function with byte num and bit position as arguments
    -> using character pointer taking byte of num 
    -> toggle the bit
-> retrun the flipped number
